The Law Awareness Weeks (LAW)@CDC 2021 is a collaboration between Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS) and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs), National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences School of Law, Singapore Management University School of Law, and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Pro Bono Chapter, supported by the People’s Association.

 

LAW@CDC 2021 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced with common legal issues.   This year, there will be 12 law awareness webinars aired ‘live’ online from 25 September - 7 November 2021.

 
### Theme: Relationships & Healing
The theme for LAW@CDC 2021 is Relationships & Healing and the range of topics are issues faced in the day-to-day lives of Singaporeans under three broad pillars of Family, Community and Employment. The webinar topics include Protecting your Loved One, Protecting Yourself, Fighting in Court or Building Bridges, Preparing for Golden Years: Get to know your Legal Instruments, Documents and Processes (English and Mandarin), Becoming a Family, Two-gather but not Together,  Help! I am a Victim of Online Harassment, Divorce and You (Civil), Divorce and You (Syariah) and My Idea, My Property!  With the present endemic, we have added topics in response to these challenges during this time – Freelancing from Home – The Dos and Don’ts of Home-based Businesses and Am I Still Employable? Navigating your Job from Pandemic to Endemic. We will also be looking at the up-coming trend of instant online attention in Trading Fame in the Virtual Space: Legal Guide for Social Media Influencers and Users.

 

Our moderators together with our panellists, will discuss on the respective topics.  Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any doubts they may have on the law relating to the topics.  Catered to audiences with no legal background, the legal talks aim to simplify legal jargon and explain the law as it applies to the man on the street as well as how they can see recourse in order to heal the relationships that they are in.

 

Relationships are precious. Heal relationships with those around you.
