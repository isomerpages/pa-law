## School of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences

The SUSS School of Law’s primary focus is to support the nation’s efforts to train and produce first-rate practitioners in the areas of criminal law and family practice.

Accordingly, our LLB and JD programmes adopt a pedagogical approach that emphasises problem-solving, by splicing the learning of substantive law with practice-oriented application.

Exposure to cross-disciplinary fields, as well as opportunities for all students to engage meaningfully with members of both the Bar and the Judiciary, ensure that our graduates enter the profession primed for practice not just with the foundational knowledge and skills, but also a keen sense of purpose
