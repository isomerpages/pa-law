Samson has grown the regulatory profile of Xfers by successfully obtaining a rare MAS approval in 2019 for Xfers to become a widely accepted stored value facility, one of only six in Singapore.

Later in 2020, Xfers became licensed by MAS as a Major Payment Institution under the Payment Services Act. Under this regime, Xfers launched the first regulated Singapore-dollar denominated “stablecoin” - the “XSGD”, offering consumer protections under the Payment Services Act and the technological edge of blockchain-based payments.
