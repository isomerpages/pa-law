## Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Legal Education, Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore

The Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Legal Education oversees and runs pro bono and clinical legal education programmes at NUS Law. The Centre's activities have their roots in the rich tradition of pro bono work among staff and students.

Among its key objectives, the Centre seeks to develop and enhance legal skills in NUS Law students, particularly in community lawyering, and to build legal awareness programmes primarily targeted at the social service sector so as to provide legal assistance to such organisations, and thereby promote the welfare of vulnerable members in our community.

## School of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences

The SUSS School of Law’s primary focus is to support the nation’s efforts to train and produce first-rate practitioners in the areas of criminal law and family practice.

Accordingly, our LLB and JD programmes adopt a pedagogical approach that emphasises problem-solving, by splicing the learning of substantive law with practice-oriented application.

Exposure to cross-disciplinary fields, as well as opportunities for all students to engage meaningfully with members of both the Bar and the Judiciary, ensure that our graduates enter the profession primed for practice not just with the foundational knowledge and skills, but also a keen sense of purpose
