![pre launch hero image](/images/pre%20launch%20hero%20image.png)The Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC 2023 (LAW@CDC 2023) is a collaboration between Pro Bono SG and the five Community Development Councils, National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences School of Law, Singapore Management University School of Law, the Singapore Association of Social Workers and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Pro Bono Chapter, supported by the People’s Association.

LAW@CDC 2023 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced with common legal issues.   This year, there will be 11 law awareness webinars aired ‘live’ online from 16 September - 1 November 2023.

The theme for LAW@CDC 2023 is ***Collective Impact, A Community in Action*** and the range of topics focuses on the day-to-day lives of Singaporeans. The webinar topics includes Advance Legal Planning on wills and end-of-life matters, Conflicts with Neighbours – can this be resolved? and What is Workplace Harassment and how do I deal with it?.  Shedding spotlight on the work social workers do in the community, we have added topics in response to these challenges during this time – Divorce matters and concerns - Custody, Care and Control, Dealing with or Encountering Family Violence? and Syariah divorce and Related Matters. We will be looking at the constant threat of online scams in Protect Yourself - How to Spot and Avoid Scams. A few of these topics will also be presented in Malay and Mandarin.

  
Our moderators together with our panellists, will discuss on the respective topics.  Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any doubts they may have on the law relating to the topics.  Catered to audiences with no legal background, the legal talks aim to simplify legal jargon and explain the law as it applies to the man on the street as well as how they can see recourse in order to heal the relationships that they are in.
