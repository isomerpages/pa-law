### FOO MENG YEEN
As a legal counsel in health technology fraternity, I have personal inclination to want to know more about health and its impact on individuals and families. This brings about also a keen interest on the consequences when health of any individual is no longer ablet to support continuation of the individual in living capacity. Questions asked of me by friends who have had to walk the journey of sickness and also face the loss of loved ones and agonies they have to face when issues of material resources arise, have made me aware of how much having knowledge about the law can assist one be prepared for crises and to reduce or prevent further crises upon crises. I am therefore hopeful that this topic being covered under SCCA pro bono program will bring real benefit to the participants.
