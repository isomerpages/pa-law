## National University of Singapore, Faculty of Law, Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Education

The Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Legal Education is the central body that oversees and runs pro bono programmes and the clinical legal education programme at NUS Law. The Centre's activities have their roots in the rich tradition of pro bono work among staff and students.

Among its key objectives, the Centre seeks to develop and enhance legal skills in NUS Law students, particularly in community lawyering, and to build legal awareness programmes primarily targeted at the social service sector so as to strengthen legal assistance that can be provided to such organisations that promote the welfare of the vulnerable in society.

In doing so, the Centre aims to prepare NUS Law students for real-world practice by exposing them to the challenges of delivering quality legal service while serving the community.&nbsp;

## Singapore Management University, Pro Bono Centre

As a stakeholder of Singapore’s justice system, the Singapore Management University (SMU) Pro Bono Centre has advocated a pro bono culture amongst law students through various pro bono programmes ever since the founding of the SMU Yong Pung How School of Law in 2007.&nbsp;

In 2013, the Centre started a free legal clinic to enhance access to justice for disadvantaged members of public and the training of law students. The clinic has since grown from a fortnightly service to a weekly service in 2017.

Through a wide range of programmes, the Centre aims to help law students gain a deeper understanding of the needs of our society and the less privileged, and cultivate in them a sense of service – of what it means to give without expecting anything in return.

## Singapore University of Social Sciences, School of Law


The SUSS School of Law’s primary focus is to support the nation’s efforts to train and produce first-rate practitioners in the areas of criminal law and family practice.

Accordingly, our LLB and JD programmes adopt a pedagogical approach that emphasises problem-solving, by splicing the learning of substantive law with practice-oriented application.

Exposure to cross-disciplinary fields, as well as opportunities for all students to engage meaningfully with members of both the Bar and the Judiciary, ensure that our graduates enter the profession primed for practice not just with the foundational knowledge and skills, but also a keen sense of purpose.
