The Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC 2024 (LAW@CDC 2024) is a collaboration between the five Community Development Councils and Pro Bono SG, National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences School of Law, Singapore Management University School of Law, the Singapore Association of Social Workers and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Pro Bono Chapter, supported by the People’s Association.

LAW@CDC 2024 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced with common legal issues.   This year, there will be 13 law awareness webinars aired ‘live’ online from 16 September - 30 October 2024. There will also be a series of in-person legal talks happening in the community.

The theme for LAW@CDC 2024 is **Green Justice for Sustainable Communities**, designed to educate the public on laws protecting nature and the environment. The theme aims to foster appreciation and respect for these legal frameworks while empowering individuals to contribute to a more sustainable future. The Green Justice webinar topi*cs include Your Backyard Sanctuary: Legal Protections for Singapore's Biodiversity, Furry Friends, Fair Treatment: Understandin*g A*nimal Welfare Laws and Combatting Pollution: towards a Greener and better Singapore*.  Not forgetting our Eve*rgreen webinar topics – Divorce under Civil Law, Divorce under Syariah Law, Dealing with or Encountering Family Violence? and Advance Legal Planning on Wills and *End-of-Life Matters. We will also be looking at the constant threats of being online in Help! I am a Victim of Online Harassment!, Protect Yourself - How to Spot and Avoid Scams and Be CyberSafe!

Our moderators together with our panellists, will discuss on the respective topics.  Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any doubts they may have on the law relating to the topics.  Catered to audiences with no legal background, the legal talks aim to simplify legal jargon and explain the law as it applies to the man on the street as well as how they can see recourse in order to heal the relationships that they are in.
