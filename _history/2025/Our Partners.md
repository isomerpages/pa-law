<h4><strong>National University of Singapore, Faculty of Law, Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Education</strong></h4>
<p>The Centre for Pro Bono &amp; Clinical Legal Education is the central
body that oversees and runs pro bono programmes and the clinical legal
education programme at NUS Law. The Centre's activities have their roots
in the rich tradition of pro bono work among staff and students.</p>
<p>Among its key objectives, the Centre seeks to develop and enhance legal
skills in NUS Law students, particularly in community lawyering, and to
build legal awareness programmes primarily targeted at the social service
sector so as to strengthen legal assistance that can be provided to such
organisations that promote the welfare of the vulnerable in society.</p>
<p>In doing so, the Centre aims to prepare NUS Law students for real-world
practice by exposing them to the challenges of delivering quality legal
service while serving the community.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Singapore Management University, Pro Bono Centre</strong></h4>
<p>As a stakeholder of Singapore’s justice system, the Singapore Management
University (SMU) Pro Bono Centre has advocated a pro bono culture amongst
law students through various pro bono programmes ever since the founding
of the SMU Yong Pung How School of Law in 2007.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, the Centre started a free legal clinic to enhance access to justice
for disadvantaged members of public and the training of law students. The
clinic has since grown from a fortnightly service to a weekly service in
2017.</p>
<p>Through a wide range of programmes, the Centre aims to help law students
gain a deeper understanding of the needs of our society and the less privileged,
and cultivate in them a sense of service – of what it means to give without
expecting anything in return.</p>

<h4><strong>Singapore University of Social Sciences, School of Law</strong></h4>
<p>The SUSS School of Law’s primary focus is to support the nation’s efforts

law and family practice.</p>

emphasises problem-solving, by splicing the learning of substantive law
with practice-oriented application.</p>

students to engage meaningfully with members of both the Bar and the Judiciary,
ensure that our graduates enter the profession primed for practice not

of purpose.</p>
