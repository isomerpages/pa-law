</div>
<p>Katherine brings to every mediation table a rare combination of strategic insight, emotional intelligence, and deep operational knowledge of dispute resolution.
</p><p>Her 16-year career at Maxwell Chambers wasn’t just about growing an institution—it was about understanding how conflict unfolds and what people truly need to move forward.
</p><p>Katherine has been a driving force behind Singapore’s rise as a global hub for dispute resolution. But behind every milestone in her journey lies a deeper story—one of a passionate peacemaker, an empathetic listener, and a determined leader who believes in the power of dialogue to resolve even the most entrenched disputes.
</p><p>Katherine’s professional journey began with a vision—to elevate Singapore's role in the global dispute resolution space. In 2009, she led the pioneering launch of Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) complex. At the time, this was uncharted territory. Yet under Katherine’s bold and strategic leadership, Maxwell Chambers quickly gained international recognition, offering state-of-the-art hearing rooms and housing world-renowned arbitration and mediation institutions under one roof.
</p><p>Her role wasn’t confined to infrastructure and operations. Katherine spent years working closely with international stakeholders, legal professionals, arbitrators, and mediators, managing complex dynamics and creating spaces that allowed disputes to be resolved with dignity. These experiences gave her an exceptional understanding of people, conflict, and what resolution really requires — empathy, clarity, and trust.
</p><p>In 2019, she once again made her mark by spearheading the expansion into Maxwell Chambers Suites, reinforcing Singapore’s global status as a premier dispute resolution destination. Her leadership not only transformed a building — it reshaped how the world viewed Singapore’s ADR landscape.
</p><p>But beyond the boardrooms and strategic plans, Katherine found her calling in mediation. The countless interactions with clients in dispute resolution over the years sparked a personal desire to become directly involved in helping people move from conflict to resolution.
</p><p>Katherine is a certified Associate/Family Mediator with the Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC), the Singapore International Mediation Institution (SIMI) and a Master Mediator at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC).
</p><p>Her experience at Maxwell Chambers has uniquely positioned her with a 360-degree perspective — not just on the legal and logistical frameworks of mediation, but also on the human dynamics that drive conflict.
</p><p>Her ability to connect with people from all walks of life, coupled with her structured, solution-oriented approach, makes her a trusted, effective mediator — one who balances compassion with clarity, and firmness with fairness.
</p><p>Whether it’s a family dispute, a workplace conflict, or a community issue, Katherine approaches each mediation with one goal in mind: to guide parties towards common ground and create lasting, meaningful resolutions.
