<p>The Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC 2025 (LAW@CDC 2025) is a collaboration between
the five Community Development Councils and Pro Bono SG, National University
of Singapore Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences School
of Law, Singapore Management University School of Law, the Singapore Association
of Social Workers and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Pro Bono
Chapter, supported by the People’s Association.</p>
<p>LAW@CDC 2025 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding
of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living
and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced
with common legal issues. This year, there will be 15 law awareness webinars
aired ‘live’ online from <strong>22 September 2025 - 30 October 2025</strong>.
There will also be a series of in-person legal talks happening in the community.</p>
<p>The theme for LAW@CDC 2025 is <strong>Celebrate SG60 – Connect, Contribute, and Care for Our Community</strong>,
designed to honour Singapore’s 60 years of nation-building and reflect
on the shared values that have united us over this time. The theme also
highlights the CDCs’ commitment to building Learning and Sustainable communities,
while supporting the national agenda on Access to Justice, an essential
pillar of the Rule of Law in Singapore. The webinar topics&nbsp;include&nbsp;<em>LPA, Wills and End of Life Matters, Social Media &amp; the Law – Post with Prudence, Legal Toolkit for Ground-Up Community Action, Workplace Rights &amp; Responsibilities, Youth Offences &amp; Bullying – Legal Guidance for Parents &amp; Educators, Invisible Disabilities &amp; the Law – Know Your Protections, and Animal Welfare Laws – Caring for Our Companions.</em>
</p>
<p>Our moderators together with our panelists, will discuss on the respective
topics.&nbsp;Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and
clarify any doubts they may have on the law relating to the topics.&nbsp;Catered
to audiences with no legal background, the legal talks aim to simplify
legal jargon and explain the law as it applies to the man on the street
as well as how they can see recourse in order to heal the relationships
that they are in.</p>
