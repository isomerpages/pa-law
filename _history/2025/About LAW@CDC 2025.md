<p>The Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC 2025 (LAW@CDC 2025) is a collaboration between
Pro Bono SG and the five Community Development Councils, National University
of Singapore Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences School
of Law, Singapore Management University School of Law, the Singapore Association
of Social Workers and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association Pro Bono
Chapter, supported by the People’s Association.</p>
<p>LAW@CDC 2025 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding
of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living
and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced
with common legal issues. This year, there will be 15 law awareness webinars
aired ‘live’ online from 22 September - 30 October 2025. There will also
be a series of in-person legal talks happening in the community.</p>
<p>As Singapore marks SG60, this year’s LAW@CDC campaign invites everyone
to learn how the law helps us build stronger, safer, and more supportive
communities. The theme <em>“Let’s Connect, Contribute and Care for our Community”</em> brings
together a series of free public webinars that explore everyday legal issues
and empower you to take informed action — for yourself and those around
you.</p>
