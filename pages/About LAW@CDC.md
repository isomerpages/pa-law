The Law Awareness Weeks @ CDC 2022 (LAW@CDC 2022) is a collaboration between Law Society Pro Bono Services (LSPBS) and the five Community Development Councils (CDCs), National University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of Law, Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) School of Law, Singapore Management University (SMU) School of Law, and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association (SCCA) Pro Bono Chapter, supported by the People’s Association (PA).

LAW@CDC 2022 is a nationwide effort to promote awareness and understanding of the law in the community through a series of talks, so that people living and working in Singapore may know their rights and be empowered when faced with common legal issues.   This year, there will be 11 law awareness webinars aired ‘live’ online from 27 September 2022 to 27 October 2022.

The theme for LAW@CDC 2022 is **_Staying Cybersafe – Protecting Yourself and the Community_** and the range of topics are cyber-related issues faced in the day-to-day lives of Singaporeans. The webinar topics includes **_Neighbour or Foe?, Preparing for Golden Years, Harassment at the Workplace - is help available?, Divorce & You (Civil), Divorce & You (Syariah)_** and **_Legal Considerations for Caregivers._**  With the rise in cyber-related issues, we have added topics in response to these challenges during this time – **_Help! I am a Victim of Online Harm, So You Want to be a Social Media Influencer?_** and **_Online Shopping – Is It Safe?_**. We will be looking at the constant threat of online scams in **_Believe It or Not! How to Spot and Avoid Scams_**. We will also be looking to help individuals and organisations who face the possible threat of data breaches in **_Be_** **_CyberSafe!_**

Our moderators together with our panellists, will discuss on the respective topics.  Participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and clarify any doubts they may have on the law relating to the topics.  Catered to audiences with no legal background, the legal talks aim to simplify legal jargon and explain the law as it applies to the man on the street as well as how they can see recourse in order to heal the relationships that they are in.
